# Introducing EduSense: 
# Guiding AI Use in Education
EduSense is a web application designed to **govern and guide the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), within an educational environment.

# The Problem
The increasing reliance on AI tools such as ChatGPT for schoolwork raises **concerns about the decline of essential student skills**, including critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. Studies indicate that students who depend too heavily on AI for assignments may score lower and struggle with analytical reasoning, often trusting AI-generated responses without proper verification. This misuse can subvert the learning process and lead to poorer quality work, making it difficult for educators to assess true comprehension.


# The Solution: EduSense
EduSense transforms LLMs into an **intentional educational tool** for both students and educators.

# For Students
It encourages students to "think first" by employing features such as **guided questions**, **reflective prompts**, and **challenge modes** that limit or delay direct AI input.

This approach is designed to prevent over-reliance on AI and help students build stronger critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

# For Educators
EduSense provides **essential oversight features** to effectively manage AI use in assignments.

Educators can **upload assignments**, **monitor student LLM interactions,** and utilize features such as **usage tracking** and **copy/paste restrictions** to review how students are engaging with the AI.

This ensures that AI is **supporting, not subverting**, the learning process, and helps educators identify problem areas in comprehension.

EduSense is currently in development with the core purpose of teaching students **how to use LLMs as an effective educational aid**, rather than a shortcut to direct answers.
